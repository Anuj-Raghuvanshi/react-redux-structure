# KW UI Kit - Guiding Principles

### Composability

React itself was designed around a component-based architecture and this UI Kit is no different. Consider each component as a lego that can be combined with others to build something more complex.

### Consistency

Instead of front-end developers having to worry about writing similar CSS to match the design standards, the Kit has the standards baked-in to create consistency between applications.

### Focus on Business Logic

Since the design standards are already implemented in the components, you can spend more time writing the business-logic of your application instead of worrying about how components look.
